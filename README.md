# BiteMap Final Project INFO 441

# Product Description
BiteMap is designed for food enthusiasts who crave a more personalized dining experience, going beyond traditional restaurant reviews to explore the best dishes on a menu. The target audience includes food lovers, travelers, and anyone with specific dietary preferences or restrictions who wishes to make informed choices about what they eat. Unlike other review platforms that focus broadly on restaurant quality, BiteMap zeroes in on individual menu items, helping users uncover hidden culinary gems by offering insights about specific dietary restrictions that each dish caters to.


BiteMap benefits people with specific dietary needs, such as vegetarians and individuals with gluten allergies, by offering robust filtering options. Users can search for dishes based on dietary needs, ensuring a tailored dining experience that respects their preferences and health considerations. With BiteMap, food lovers gain the confidence to explore new places, knowing they’ll find recommendations suited to their preferences.


As developers, we are passionate about food and believe in making dining an inclusive, enriching experience for everyone. We want to build BiteMap to foster a community of food enthusiasts who can share and discover incredible dishes together. The app’s unique focus on menu item specifics fills a gap in the food discovery market, offering users a new level of dining personalization that enhances their food journeys and empowers them to make well-informed choices.
