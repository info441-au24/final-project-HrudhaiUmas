# User Stories
1. As a user with strict dietary restrictions, I want to be able to update my dietary information and only receive recommendations that account for my needs so I can be worry-free about what I eat.

2. As a user, I want to be able to search for food items and see a list of all those dishes in Seattle so I can try them out .

3. As a user, I want to be able to see the restaurant name and address for every food item when I search them up so I know exactly where I can get that item.

4. As a user, I want to be able to add tags to a dish after I have tried it so other users can know about dietary restrictions that may not have been added earlier. 

5. As someone who is indecisive when it comes to food, I want BiteMap to give me recommendations about foods I should try based on a cuisine of my choosing so that I donâ€™t have to decide for myself.

6. As a restaurant owner, I want to upload food items from my restaurant and be able to include dietary information so my customers can get a better idea of what we provide.
